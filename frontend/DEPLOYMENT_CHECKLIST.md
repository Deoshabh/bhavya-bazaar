### Webpack Production Optimization
```javascript
// Already implemented in webpack.config.js
- Code splitting for vendors, MUI, and Redux
- Compression with Brotli and Gzip
- Bundle analysis capabilities
- Minification and tree shaking
```

### Health Check Endpoint
```
GET /health
Response: {
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-08T19:30:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600000,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "websocket": "healthy",
    "redis": "healthy"
  }
}
```

## üö® Critical Issues to Monitor

1. **DataGrid Performance**: Monitor for empty/zero dimension issues
2. **Null Reference Errors**: Track any remaining null/undefined access
3. **WebSocket Stability**: Monitor connection drops and reconnection success
4. **Bundle Size Growth**: Alert if any bundle exceeds size limits
5. **Memory Leaks**: Monitor for increasing memory usage patterns

## üìû Emergency Contacts

- **Development Team**: [Your team contact]
- **DevOps/Infrastructure**: [Infrastructure team contact]
- **Product Owner**: [Product owner contact]

## üìù Rollback Procedures

1. **Quick Rollback**: Revert to previous Docker image
2. **Database Rollback**: Apply reverse migrations if needed
3. **CDN Cache**: Clear CDN cache for updated assets
4. **Health Check**: Verify all services are healthy after rollback
