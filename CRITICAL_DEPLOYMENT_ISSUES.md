# 🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## ❌ Current Status: BACKEND SERVICE DOWN

Based on the error logs, here are the critical issues that need immediate attention:

### 🔥 **PRIORITY 1: Backend Service Down (502 Bad Gateway)**

**Issue:** All API requests are failing with 502 errors:
```
GET https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2/product/get-all-products net::ERR_FAILED 502 (Bad Gateway)
POST https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2/user/login-user net::ERR_FAILED
```

**Root Cause:** Backend service is not running or misconfigured in Coolify

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

#### Step 1: Check Backend Service Status in Coolify
1. Go to **Coolify Panel** → **Services** → **Backend Service**
2. Check if the service is **RUNNING** (green status)
3. If it's **STOPPED** or **FAILED** (red status), restart it

#### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these exact environment variables are set in Coolify Backend Service:

```bash
# CRITICAL - Must be exactly as shown:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8000
CORS_ORIGIN=https://bhavyabazaar.com,https://www.bhavyabazaar.com,https://api.bhavyabazaar.com

# Database & Secrets
DB_URI=mongodb://root:jmU9RAj8gDoz794KNPk1f7GkIKjX0bnqLZ1DSnylnnsTjuJG5CStX1IuTD4ZA9BO@hk0w48gckcgcwggkgwg04wgo:27017/bhavya-bazar?authSource=admin
JWT_SECRET_KEY=c4d6c1e15acc2b4461c15b1f7fc6e58f83e03dd48ff5b5ac41fbf3afd10a3113
ACTIVATION_SECRET=c4d6c1e15acc2b4461c15b1f7fc6e58f83e03dd48ff5b5ac41fbf3afd10a3113

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=r0sssg8g8wog48ggcgc0s4go
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=ey66XSWpPTBQuAzKdWRWBD3oHwr5p4iSUie5DRoLoIKgeZM4YZoSufSQEw9Mp3c4
```

#### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
1. In Coolify Backend Service → **Logs** tab
2. Look for these success messages:
   ```bash
   🚀 Server listening on port 8000
   🌐 Allowed CORS origins: [array of origins]
   ✅ Redis connection initialized
   ```
3. If you see errors, note them and fix accordingly

### 🔧 **PRIORITY 2: Frontend Hot Reload Issue**

**Issue:** Development webpack server trying to connect to old URL:
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://bhavyabazaar.com:3005/ws' failed
```

**Solution:** This is likely cached or from development mode. Not critical for production but can be fixed by:
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Ensure frontend is in production mode (not dev server)

### ⚠️ **PRIORITY 3: SVG Property Warnings**

**Issue:** React warnings about SVG properties:
```
Warning: Invalid DOM property `stroke-width`. Did you mean `strokeWidth`?
```

**Impact:** Non-critical, but should be fixed for clean console

**Fix Applied:** I've already updated the frontend WebSocket URLs. Need to find and fix SVG properties.

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### Step 1: Fix Backend Service (CRITICAL)
1. **Check Coolify Backend Service Status**
   - If stopped: Start it
   - If failed: Check logs and restart

2. **Verify Environment Variables Match Above**
   - Especially `PORT=8000` and `CORS_ORIGIN`
   - Remove any `WS_ORIGIN` variable

3. **Redeploy Backend Service**
   - Force redeploy if needed
   - Monitor logs for successful startup

### Step 2: Update Frontend Code (COMPLETED)
✅ Fixed WebSocket URLs in `frontend/src/server.js`:
- Changed from `wss://bhavyabazaar.com/socket.io`
- Changed to `wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/socket.io`

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend Service
1. **Commit the code changes**
2. **Redeploy frontend service in Coolify**
3. **Clear browser cache after deployment**

## 🧪 **TESTING AFTER FIXES**

### Test 1: Backend Health Check
```bash
curl https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","service":"backend"}
```

### Test 2: WebSocket Connection
```javascript
// In browser console on https://bhavyabazaar.com
const socket = io('wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/socket.io');
socket.on('connect', () => console.log('✅ WebSocket connected'));
```

### Test 3: API Requests
- Try logging in
- Check if products load
- Verify no CORS errors

## 📊 **STATUS CHECKLIST**

Priority tasks to complete:

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Backend service running in Coolify
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Environment variables updated
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Backend logs show successful startup
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** API endpoints responding (not 502)
- [ ] Frontend code updated (✅ DONE)
- [ ] Frontend deployed with latest changes
- [ ] WebSocket connects to correct URL
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Login/API functionality working

## 🆘 **IF BACKEND STILL FAILS**

If backend service won't start or keeps failing:

1. **Check Coolify Resource Limits**
   - Memory/CPU allocation
   - Disk space

2. **Check Database Connection**
   - Verify MongoDB URI is accessible
   - Test Redis connection

3. **Check Domain/DNS Configuration**
   - Ensure `api.bhavyabazaar.com` points to Coolify
   - Verify SSL certificate

4. **Restart from Clean State**
   - Stop all services
   - Clear any cached builds
   - Redeploy both services

The **MAIN ISSUE** is that your backend service is down (502 errors). Everything else is secondary. Focus on getting the backend running first! 🔥
