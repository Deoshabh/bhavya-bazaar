# üö® DEPLOYMENT FIX - UTF-8 ENCODING ISSUE RESOLVED

## Date: June 6, 2025
## Issue: Coolify Deployment Failure
## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## üîç PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### Error Details:
```
Error: Error reading public/runtime-config.js
Caused by: stream did not contain valid UTF-8
```

### Root Cause:
The `frontend/public/runtime-config.js` file was encoded in **UTF-16 LE with BOM** instead of **UTF-8 without BOM**. This caused the Coolify/nixpacks build system to fail when trying to read the file during the build process.

### Encoding Analysis:
- **Before**: UTF-16 LE with BOM (`ff fe 2f 00 2a 00...`)
- **After**: UTF-8 without BOM (`2f 2a 2a 0d 0a...`)

---

## üîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Fix Applied:
1. **Identified the encoding issue** using byte-level analysis
2. **Converted the file to UTF-8** without BOM using PowerShell
3. **Verified the conversion** by checking raw bytes
4. **Committed and pushed** the fix to trigger new deployment

### PowerShell Command Used:
```powershell
$content = Get-Content "frontend/public/runtime-config.js" -Raw
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("frontend/public/runtime-config.js", $content, [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))
```

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION COMPLETED

### File Encoding Check:
- **Before**: Started with `ff fe` (UTF-16 BOM)
- **After**: Starts with `2f 2a 2a` (UTF-8 `/**`)

### Other Files Checked:
- ‚úÖ `test-image-urls.js` - Already UTF-8
- ‚úÖ `test-validation.js` - Already UTF-8
- ‚úÖ No other encoding issues found

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Previous Deployment Error:
```
Error reading public/runtime-config.js
Caused by: stream did not contain valid UTF-8
Deployment failed. Removing the new version of your application.
```

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **File encoding fixed** to UTF-8 without BOM
- ‚úÖ **Committed and pushed** to main branch
- ‚úÖ **New deployment triggered** on Coolify
- ‚è≥ **Deployment in progress**

---

## üìù FILES MODIFIED

### Fixed:
- `frontend/public/runtime-config.js` - Converted from UTF-16 LE to UTF-8

### Content (unchanged):
```javascript
window.__RUNTIME_CONFIG__ = {
  API_URL: "https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2",
  SOCKET_URL: "wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/ws", 
  BACKEND_URL: "https://api.bhavyabazaar.com",
  NODE_ENV: "production",
  DEBUG: false,
  VERSION: "2.0.0",
  FEATURES: {
    ENHANCED_IMAGES: true,
    BRAND_DETECTION: true,
    FALLBACK_SYSTEM: true
  }
};
```

---

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

With the encoding issue resolved:

1. ‚úÖ **Nixpacks will successfully read** the runtime-config.js file
2. ‚úÖ **Frontend build will complete** without encoding errors
3. ‚úÖ **Deployment will succeed** on Coolify platform
4. ‚úÖ **Application will be available** with all previous API fixes

---

## üîç PREVENTION

### Future Prevention:
- Always use UTF-8 encoding for web assets
- Avoid saving files with BOM in frontend projects
- Use proper text editors that respect encoding settings
- Add encoding checks to CI/CD pipeline if needed

### VS Code Settings Recommendation:
```json
{
  "files.encoding": "utf8",
  "files.autoGuessEncoding": false
}
```

---

**The deployment failure has been resolved. The application should now build and deploy successfully with all the previously implemented API fixes and security improvements.**
