# Authentication System Complete Replacement Plan

## Overview
Complete replacement of JWT-based authentication with express-session + connect-redis for a multi-role e-commerce platform supporting user/shop/admin authentication.

## Current System Analysis
- Multiple JWT tokens (token, seller_token, admin_token)
- Complex cookie domain handling
- Token blacklisting system
- Persistent logout issues on page reload
- JWT expiry management complexity

## Target System
- Single session-based authentication
- Redis-backed session storage
- Automatic session refresh
- Multi-role support in single session
- No token expiry issues

---

## Phase 1: Session Infrastructure Setup
```
Implement Phase 1: Replace JWT authentication with express-session and connect-redis. Install and configure express-session with Redis store. Remove jsonwebtoken dependency and set up session configuration with secure settings for production (.bhavyabazaar.com domain). Configure session store with proper expiration, security flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite), and multi-role session structure.
```

## Phase 2: Session Management Utilities
```
Implement Phase 2: Create session management utilities to replace JWT token functions. Remove jwtToken.js and shopToken.js files. Create session creation functions for user/shop/admin roles, session validation helpers, session refresh mechanisms, and session cleanup utilities. Design unified session data structure that supports all three user types (user, shop, admin) in a single session object.
```

## Phase 3: Authentication Controller Replacement
```
Implement Phase 3: Completely rewrite backend/controller/auth.js to use session-based authentication. Remove all JWT login endpoints (/login/user, /login/shop, /login/admin) and replace with unified session-based login endpoints. Remove JWT token verification from /me endpoint and implement session-based user verification. Replace JWT refresh endpoints with session refresh functionality.
```

## Phase 4: Authentication Middleware Replacement
```
Implement Phase 4: Replace JWT authentication middleware (backend/middleware/auth.js) with session-based middleware. Remove JWT token verification and implement session validation for protected routes. Update isAuthenticated, isSeller, and isAdmin middleware functions to work with session data instead of JWT tokens. Remove token blacklisting system as it's no longer needed.
```

## Phase 5: Logout System Replacement
```
Implement Phase 5: Replace JWT-based logout endpoints with session-based logout. Remove token blacklisting from all logout endpoints (/logout/user, /logout/shop, /logout/admin). Implement session destruction and proper cookie clearing. Create unified logout endpoint that destroys the current session regardless of user type.
```

## Phase 6: User Controller Updates
```
Implement Phase 6: Update backend/controller/user.js to remove JWT dependencies. Replace JWT middleware usage with session-based middleware in all user routes. Remove legacy logout endpoint that uses JWT. Update all user-related endpoints to work with session-based authentication instead of token verification.
```

## Phase 7: Shop Controller Updates
```
Implement Phase 7: Update backend/controller/shop.js to use session-based authentication. Replace JWT middleware (isSeller) with session-based seller authentication. Remove JWT token dependencies from shop-related endpoints. Update shop creation, management, and access control to work with session-based authentication.
```

## Phase 8: Admin Controller Updates
```  
Implement Phase 8: Update all admin-related controllers to use session-based authentication. Replace JWT admin middleware with session-based admin verification. Remove JWT token dependencies from admin endpoints. Update admin dashboard access, user management, and admin-only features to work with session authentication.
```

## Phase 9: Frontend Authentication Utils Replacement
```
Implement Phase 9: Completely rewrite frontend/src/utils/auth.js to remove JWT token handling. Remove JWT token storage, validation, and management functions. Implement session-based authentication utilities including session verification, automatic session refresh on page load, and proper error handling for session expiry. Remove cookie manipulation for JWT tokens.
```

## Phase 10: Redux Authentication State Replacement
```
Implement Phase 10: Update Redux authentication actions (frontend/src/redux/actions/user.js) to remove JWT token handling. Replace token-based state management with session-based authentication state. Update authentication reducers to work with session data instead of storing JWT tokens. Remove token refresh actions and implement session-based state persistence.
```

## Phase 11: Frontend Route Protection Update
```
Implement Phase 11: Update all frontend route protection components to use session-based authentication. Replace JWT token verification in protected routes with session-based authentication checks. Update HOC authentication wrapper (frontend/src/hoc/withAuth.jsx) to work with session data. Remove JWT token checking from route guards.
```

## Phase 12: Frontend Login Components Update
```
Implement Phase 12: Update all login components (LoginForm, AdminLogin, ShopLogin) to work with session-based authentication. Remove JWT token handling from login success callbacks. Update login error handling to work with session-based responses. Ensure proper redirect handling after successful session-based login.
```

## Phase 13: Frontend User State Management
```
Implement Phase 13: Update frontend user state management throughout the application. Remove JWT token dependencies from user profile components, dashboard components, and user-specific features. Update user data fetching to use session-based endpoints. Ensure proper session refresh on user interactions.
```

## Phase 14: Complete JWT System Removal
```
Implement Phase 14: Remove all remaining JWT-related code, files, and dependencies. Delete backend/utils/jwtToken.js, backend/utils/shopToken.js, and backend/middleware/tokenBlacklist.js files. Remove jsonwebtoken from package.json dependencies. Clean up any remaining JWT imports, token verification code, and JWT-related environment variables.
```

## Phase 15: Session Security and Production Configuration
```
Implement Phase 15: Configure session security settings for production deployment. Set up Redis session store with proper security configurations. Configure session cookie security (domain: .bhavyabazaar.com, secure: true, httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'none'). Implement session timeout and cleanup mechanisms. Add session monitoring and error handling for production environment.
```

## Phase 16: Testing and Validation
```
Implement Phase 16: Test the complete session-based authentication system. Verify login/logout functionality for all user types (user, shop, admin). Test session persistence across page reloads and browser refreshes. Validate multi-role authentication and proper role-based access control. Ensure no JWT-related errors remain in the application. Test session expiry and automatic cleanup.
```

## Phase 17: Production Deployment and Monitoring
```
Implement Phase 17: Deploy the session-based authentication system to production. Configure Redis session store for production environment. Monitor session creation, validation, and cleanup in production. Verify that page reload logout issues are completely resolved. Set up logging and monitoring for session-based authentication performance and errors.
