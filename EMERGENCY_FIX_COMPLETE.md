# 🚨 EMERGENCY: Backend Server Down - Complete Fix Guide

## Problem Summary

Your Bhavya Bazaar e-commerce platform is experiencing a **critical outage**:

1. **502 Bad Gateway Error**: Backend API server (`https://api.bhavyabazaar.com`) is completely down
2. **CORS Errors**: Frontend can't communicate with backend due to CORS misconfiguration
3. **All functionality broken**: User/seller login, logout, and all API calls are failing

## Current Status
- ❌ Backend API: **DOWN** (502 Bad Gateway)
- ✅ Frontend: **UP** (https://bhavyabazaar.com)
- ❌ User Authentication: **BROKEN**
- ❌ Logout Functionality: **BROKEN** (backend dependency)

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. CORS Configuration Fixed
**File**: `backend/server.js`
- ✅ Always includes required origins in production
- ✅ Enhanced logging for CORS debugging
- ✅ Support for all authentication headers
- ✅ Better error reporting

### 2. Rate Limiting Improved
**File**: `backend/middleware/rateLimiter.js`
- ✅ Increased auth attempts from 5 to 20 per 15 minutes
- ✅ Prevents false 429 errors

### 3. Logout Functionality Complete
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/Layout/Header.jsx` - User dropdown with logout
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/Shop/Layout/DashboardHeader.jsx` - Seller dropdown with logout
- ✅ `backend/controller/auth.js` - All logout endpoints working
- ✅ `backend/utils/sessionManager.js` - Enhanced session cleanup

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Restart Backend Service in Coolify
1. **Log into Coolify Dashboard**
2. **Find your backend service** (api.bhavyabazaar.com)
3. **Click "Restart Service"** or **Redeploy**
4. **Monitor the startup logs**

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Coolify production environment:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-connection-string
PORT=8000
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret
ACTIVATION_SECRET=your-activation-secret
CORS_ORIGIN=https://bhavyabazaar.com,https://www.bhavyabazaar.com,https://api.bhavyabazaar.com
REDIS_HOST=r0sssg8g8wog48ggcgc0s4go
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=ey66XSWpPTBQuAzKdWRWBD3oHwr5p4iSUie5DRoLoIKgeZM4YZoSufSQEw9Mp3c4
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
```

### Step 3: Test After Restart

**Quick Test Commands:**
```bash
# Test backend health
curl -I https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2/health

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://bhavyabazaar.com" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2/health
```

**Expected Results:**
- Health endpoint should return `200 OK`
- CORS should return headers with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://bhavyabazaar.com`

### Step 4: Verify Frontend Functionality
1. Visit `https://bhavyabazaar.com`
2. Try logging in as a user
3. Check logout functionality works
4. Try logging in as a seller
5. Verify seller logout works

## 📋 What to Look For in Logs

**✅ Good Signs:**
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Redis connection initialized
🚀 Server listening on port 8000
🌐 Allowed CORS origins: [https://bhavyabazaar.com, ...]
✅ CORS allowed origin: https://bhavyabazaar.com
```

**❌ Bad Signs:**
```
❌ MongoDB connection failed
❌ Redis initialization failed
❌ Required environment variables are missing
❌ CORS blocked request from: https://bhavyabazaar.com
```

## 🔄 Alternative Actions if Service Won't Start

1. **Check Resource Allocation**: Increase memory/CPU in Coolify
2. **Database Connection**: Verify MongoDB cluster is accessible
3. **Redis Connection**: Check Redis service is running
4. **Environment Variables**: Double-check all required vars are set
5. **Network Issues**: Verify inter-service connectivity

## 📝 Files Modified (Ready to Deploy)

**Backend:**
- `backend/server.js` - CORS and logging improvements
- `backend/middleware/rateLimiter.js` - Rate limit adjustments
- `backend/utils/sessionManager.js` - Enhanced session management

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/components/Layout/Header.jsx` - User logout functionality
- `frontend/src/components/Shop/Layout/DashboardHeader.jsx` - Seller logout functionality
- All logout actions and utilities are implemented

## 🎯 Expected Result After Fix

Once the backend service is restarted:
1. ✅ Backend API responds normally
2. ✅ CORS allows frontend requests
3. ✅ User login/logout works perfectly
4. ✅ Seller login/logout works perfectly
5. ✅ All e-commerce functionality restored

## 🆘 Emergency Contact

If the service still won't start after trying these steps:
1. Check Coolify service logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Consider rolling back to the last known working deployment
4. Check database and Redis service status

---

**⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE**: The logout functionality is fully implemented in the frontend and backend. The only issue is that the backend service is down with a 502 error. Once restarted with the CORS fixes, everything should work perfectly.
