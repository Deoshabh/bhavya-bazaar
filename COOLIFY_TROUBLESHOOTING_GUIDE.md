# Coolify Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
Our recent deployment with critical fixes appears to have deployment issues. All API endpoints are returning 404 errors, suggesting the backend service may not be running properly.

## What We Fixed (That Should Be Working Now)
1. ‚úÖ Port configuration (default to 8000 instead of 443)
2. ‚úÖ CORS production configuration 
3. ‚úÖ Redis connection handling with fallbacks
4. ‚úÖ WebSocket server setup
5. ‚úÖ Authentication error handling
6. ‚úÖ Debug endpoint for troubleshooting

## Immediate Steps to Check in Coolify

### 1. Check Service Status
- Go to your Coolify dashboard
- Check if both frontend and backend services are "Running" (green status)
- If either is red/failed, that's the issue

### 2. Check Backend Logs
Look for these specific startup messages in backend logs:
```
üöÄ Server listening on port 8000
üåê API base: https://api.bhavyabazaar.com
‚úÖ MongoDB connection is successful!
‚úÖ Redis connection is successful! (if Redis is configured)
```

### 3. Common Issues to Look For

#### A. Port Configuration Issue
- Backend should be listening on port 8000
- Coolify should expose this port correctly
- Check if PORT environment variable is set in Coolify

#### B. Environment Variables Missing
Required variables that must be set in Coolify:
```
NODE_ENV=production
DB_URI=(your MongoDB connection string)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=(your JWT secret)
ACTIVATION_SECRET=(your activation secret)
CORS_ORIGIN=https://bhavyabazaar.com,https://www.bhavyabazaar.com
```

#### C. Build/Startup Errors
Look for error messages like:
- "Required environment variables are missing!"
- MongoDB connection errors
- Module not found errors
- Syntax errors

### 4. Quick Fix Commands

If you need to restart services:
1. In Coolify, go to your backend service
2. Click "Restart" button
3. Monitor the logs during startup

If environment variables are missing:
1. Go to Environment Variables section
2. Add the missing variables from our coolify-environment-variables.env file
3. Restart the service

### 5. Testing After Fixes

Once services are running, test these endpoints:
- `https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/` (should return JSON with API info)
- `https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2/health` (should return health status)
- `https://api.bhavyabazaar.com/api/v2/debug/env` (our new debug endpoint)
- `https://bhavyabazaar.com` (should load the frontend)

### 6. Next Steps After Services Are Running

1. Run our diagnostic script: `node scripts/accurate-production-test.js`
2. Test user registration and login
3. Verify WebSocket connections
4. Check Redis caching functionality

## Emergency Rollback
If the current deployment is broken, you can:
1. In Coolify, go to "Deployments" 
2. Find the previous working deployment
3. Click "Redeploy" on that version
4. Then we can apply fixes one by one

## Contact Points
- Backend API: https://api.bhavyabazaar.com
- Frontend: https://bhavyabazaar.com
- WebSocket: wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/ws

The most likely issue is either missing environment variables or a startup error preventing the backend from starting properly.
