**Date:** June 8, 2025  
**Critical Issue:** Authentication login loop - **RESOLVED**

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. Authentication Infinite Loop Bug
**Problem:** After logout, users couldn't log back in due to infinite refresh loop

**Root Cause:** `window.location.reload()` calls were resetting Redux authentication state

- ‚úÖ `ProfileSidebar.jsx` - Removed reload from logout handler  
- ‚úÖ `ProfileContent.jsx` - Fixed user update flow
- ‚úÖ Added proper Redux imports and state management

### 2. Production Configuration
**Problem:** Development build running in production, wrong WebSocket URLs

**Solution Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Generated optimized production build
- ‚úÖ Fixed WebSocket URL: `wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/socket.io`
- ‚úÖ Proper runtime configuration for production environment
