# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Issue
WebSocket connection error: "WebSocket connection to 'wss://bhavyabazaar.com:3005/ws' failed"

## Root Cause
The WebSocket URL configurations were inconsistent across different files:
- Some configurations pointed to `/ws` endpoint
- Others pointed to `/socket.io` endpoint (correct for Socket.IO)
- The backend Socket.IO server expects connections at `/socket.io` path

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Environment Variables
**File: `frontend/.env`**
- ✅ Updated `REACT_APP_WS_URL=wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/socket.io`

### 2. Runtime Configuration
**Files: `frontend/public/runtime-config.js` and `frontend/build/runtime-config.js`**
- ✅ Updated `SOCKET_URL: "wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/socket.io"`

### 3. Backend Configuration
**File: `backend/socket/socketHandler.js`**
- ✅ Verified Socket.IO server is correctly configured with `path: "/socket.io"`
- ✅ Verified CORS origins include all required domains

### 4. Frontend Build
- ✅ Rebuilt frontend with corrected WebSocket URLs using `npm run build:docker`

## Expected WebSocket URL Resolution

For production domain `bhavyabazaar.com`, the WebSocket client should now connect to:
```
wss://api.bhavyabazaar.com/socket.io
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: If testing locally, clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Deploy Backend**: Ensure backend is running on port 443 with Socket.IO enabled
3. **Deploy Frontend**: Deploy the newly built frontend with corrected configurations
4. **Verify HTTPS**: Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured for `api.bhavyabazaar.com`
5. **Test Connection**: Monitor browser console for successful WebSocket connection

## Troubleshooting

If port 3005 error persists:
1. Check if error is from cached version in browser
2. Verify deployment is using the latest build
3. Confirm backend is accessible at `https://api.bhavyabazaar.com`
4. Check browser network tab for actual WebSocket connection attempts

## Files Modified
- `frontend/.env`
- `frontend/public/runtime-config.js`
- `frontend/build/runtime-config.js`
